                <p>I have been an active participant in numerous national and international 
                    chess tournaments. Competing at both levels has allowed me to 
                    continuously challenge myself, improve my skills, and gain experience 
                    in various competitive environments. Each tournament has pushed me to 
                    refine my strategies and sharpen my focus.</p>

                <h3>2. Represented Bhutan in Multiple Prestigious Chess Events, Showcasing
                    Strategic Thinking and Resilience:</h3>
                <p>I’ve had the honor of representing Bhutan in several prestigious 
                    chess events, including international competitions like the Chess Olympiad. 
                    These experiences have not only highlighted my ability to think 
                    strategically under pressure but also demonstrated my resilience in 
                    facing tough opponents from around the world. Through these events, 
                    I’ve strengthened my problem-solving abilities and adaptability, both key 
                    elements in achieving success.</p>
